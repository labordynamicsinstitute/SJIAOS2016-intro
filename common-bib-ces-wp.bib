	The confidential microdata - unemployment insurance wage records,

	protection is manifested in the release of some statistics that are
	flagged as significantly distorted to preserve confidentiality. These
	statistics differ from the undistorted statistics by a significant
	proportion. Even for the significantly distorted statistics, the
	data remain analytically valid for time series properties. The released
	data can be aggregated; however, published aggregates are less distorted

  title = {Moving Up or Moving On: {W}ho Advances in the Low-Wage Labor Market},
  publisher = {Russell Sage Foundation Publications},
  year = {2005},
  author = {Fredrik Andersson and Harry J. Holzer and Julia I. Lane},
  note = {ISBN 0871540576},
  abstract = {For over a decade, policy makers have emphasized work as the best
	means to escape poverty. However, millions of working Americans still
	fall below the poverty line. Though many of these "working poor"
	remain mired in poverty for long periods, some eventually climb their
	way up the earnings ladder. These success stories show that the low
	wage labor market is not necessarily a dead end, but little research
	to date has focused on how these upwardly mobile workers get ahead.
	In "Moving Up or Moving On," Fredrik Andersson, Harry Holzer, and
	Julia Lane examine the characteristics of both employees and employers
	that lead to positive outcomes for workers.
	
	
	Using new Census data, "Moving Up or Moving On" follows a group of
	low earners over a nine-year period to analyze the behaviors and
	characteristics of individuals and employers that lead workers to
	successful career outcomes. The authors find that, in general, workers
	who "moved on" to different employers fared better than those who
	tried to "move up" within the same firm. While changing employers
	meant losing valuable job tenure and spending more time out of work
	than those who stayed put, workers who left their jobs in search
	of better opportunity elsewhere ended up with significantly higher
	earnings in the long term ? in large part because they were able
	to find employers that paid better wages and offered more possibilities
	for promotion. Yet moving on to better jobs is difficult for many
	of the working poor because they lack access to good-paying firms.
	Andersson, Holzer, and Lane demonstrate that low-wage workers tend
	to live far from good paying employers, making an improved transportation
	infrastructure a vital component of any public policy to improve
	job prospects for the poor. Labor market intermediaries can also
	help improve access to good employers. The authors find that one
	such intermediary, temporary help agencies, improved long-term outcomes
	for low-wage earners by giving them exposure to better-paying firms
	and therefore the opportunity to obtain better jobs. Taken together,
	these findings suggest that public policy can best serve the working
	poor by expanding their access to good employers, assisting them
	with job training and placement, and helping them to prepare for
	careers that combine both mobility and job retention strategies.
	
	
	"Moving Up or Moving On" offers a compelling argument about how low-wage
	workers can achieve upward mobility, and how public policy can facilitate
	the process. Clearly written and based on an abundance of new data,
	this book provides concrete, practical answers to the large questions
	surrounding the low-wage labor market.},

	two payoffs: (i) benefits may be a more cost-effective form of compensation
	than wages for employees facing high marginal tax rates, and (ii)
	benefits may attract a more stable, skilled workforce. Both should
	improve firm outcomes, but we have little evidence on this matter.
	This paper exploits a rich new dataset to examine how firm productivity
	and survival are related to benefit offering, and finds that benefit-offering
	firms have higher productivity and higher survival rates. Differences

	two key questions: 
	
	1. What is the “equilibrium” amount of worker reallocation in
	the economy – both within and across industries?
	
	2. How much does firm-level job reallocation affect the separation
	probabilities of workers?
	
	Consistent with other work, we find that there is a great deal of
	reallocation in the economy, although this varies substantially across
	demographic group. Much worker reallocation is within the economy,
	roughly evenly split between within and across broadly defined industries.
	An important new finding is that much of this reallocation is confined
	to a relatively small subset of workers that is shuffled across jobs
	– both within and across industries – in the economy. However,
	we also find that even for the most stable group of workers, firm
	level job reallocation substantially increases the probability of
	transition for even the most stable group of workers. Finally, workers
	who are employed in industries that provide low returns to tenure
	are much more likely to reallocate both within and across industries.},

	attrition to adjust the level of employment. We combine worker-level
	wage records and measures of human capital with firm-level characteristics
	of the production function, and use levels and changes in these variables
	to characterize the choice of adjustment method and speed. Firms
	are described/compared up to 9 years prior to death. We also consider
	how workers fare after leaving downsizing firms, and analyze if observed
	differences in post-separation outcomes of workers provide clues
	to the choice of adjustment speed.},

  abstract = {Empirical work in economics stresses the importance of unobserved
	firm- and person-level characteristics in the determination of wages,
	finding that these unobserved components account for the overwhelmingmajority
	of variation in wages. However, little is known about the mechanisms
	sustaining these wage differentials. This paper attempts to demystify
	the firm-side of the puzzle by developing a statistical model thatenriches
	the role that firms play in wage determination, allowing firms to
	in?uence both average wages aswell as the returns to observable worker
	characteristics.
	
	I exploit the hierarchical nature of a unique employer-employee linked
	dataset for the United States,estimating a multilevel statistical
	model of earnings that accounts for firm-specific deviations in averagewages
	as well as the returns to components of human capital - race, gender,
	education, and experience -while also controlling for person-level
	heterogeneity in earnings. These idiosyncratic prices reflect one
	aspectof firm compensation policy; another, and more novel aspect,
	is the unstructured characterization of thecovariance of these prices
	across firms.
	
	I estimate the model's variance parameters using Restricted (or Residual)
	Maximum Likelihood techniques. Results suggest that there is significant
	variation in the returns to worker characteristics across firms.
	First, estimates of the parameters of the covariance matrix of firm-specific
	returns are statistically significant. Firms that tend to pay higher
	average wages also tend to pay higher than average returns toworker
	characteristics; firms that tend to reward highly the human capital
	of men also highly reward thehuman capital of women. For instance,
	the correlation between the ?rm-speci?c returns to education formen
	and women is 0.57. Second, the firm-specific returns account for
	roughly 9% of the variation in wages - approximately 50% of the variation
	in wages explained by firm-specific intercepts alone. The inclusion
	offirm-specific returns ties variation in wages, otherwise attributable
	to firm-specific intercepts, to observablecomponents of human capital.},

	We present two practical methods of generating synthetic values when

	distribution of the confidential data, up to sampling error, on arbitrary
	subdomains. Our method maximizes data utility and minimizes incremental
	disclosure risk up to posterior uncertainty in the imputation model
